// Functions in CalcScript implement environment capture. This program
// demonstrates how this works.

x = 10

// The function `f` captures the value of `x` at the time it is defined, which
// is 10 in this case. Environment capture means that the value of `x` used
// inside `f` will always be 10, even if we change `x` later below.
f() = x * 2
print(f()) // prints 20

x = 55
print(f()) // still prints 20

[x, f()]   // returns [55, 20]
